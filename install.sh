Usage: ./install.sh [options]

  --project <path>   Copy project-scoped skills into the selected agent's project path
  --personal         Copy only the machine-scoped skills into the personal path
  --all-personal     Copy every skill into the personal path
  --claude           Install for Claude Code (default)
  --codex            Install for Codex
  --both             Install for both Claude Code and Codex
  --force            Overwrite skills that are already installed, and remove the
                     2.1.0 flutter-adapt command if one is found
  -h, --help         Show this message

Give exactly one of --project, --personal, or --all-personal.

Without --force an already-installed skill is left alone, so local edits survive.
That also means it never updates — re-run with --force to take a new version, and
diff first if you have adapted it.

Claude Code uses `.claude/skills` and `~/.claude/skills`. Codex uses `.agents/skills`
and `~/.agents/skills`. With --project, the machine-scoped skills (performance,
review-gate) also go to the selected personal path so they follow you across projects.

Vendoring is the right choice when you want the skills committed to the repo and
reviewable in pull requests alongside the code they govern. Otherwise prefer the
marketplace, which gives you updates.

Done.

Next:
  1. Restart the agent if its skills directory did not exist before.
  2. Verify the installed */skills/*/SKILL.md files.
  3. Run flutter-adapt to generate .agents/flutter-profile.yaml, so the skills describe
     your stack rather than the defaults they ship with.
